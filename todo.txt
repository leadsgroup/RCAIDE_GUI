Anshrin - PLot Export  
Anshrin - Mission tab - add table and plot 
Anshrin - Add geometry visualization window to the bottom right of the vehicle setup tab  
Anshrin - MAJOR BUG - on the mission tab, when the users mouse over over the feilds and scrolls,
            the fields change. The only way this should change is if the user clicks the dropdown and changes it.
            So far it affects the following fields "Segment Type" , "Subsegment Type"
