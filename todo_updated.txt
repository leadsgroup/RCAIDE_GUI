todo tasks (10/3) (split up tasks and group them)

(mihir) geometry tab:
3. geometry tab - nothing happens when you press load aircraft
4. removable collapsability of the side panel to make it look like a tree
idea: in the gui group based on component type (wing, fuselage, etc) so all the wings are in one page, all nacelles in one page, etc

(aadit) analysis tab:
13. analysis tab: (1) update all the options (2) Analysis --> Analysis Tree, remove the checkboxes, add am option alled None in the same dropdown as Vortex lattice method
(aerodynamics, atmosphere, planets, weights, geometry --> cannot have a None)
14. merge atmosphere and planet into one dropdown (option would be 1976 standard atm + earth)
15. weights should have a drop down menu

on hold:
10. menu to the left and stuff on top (flora's code) --> merge with visualize geometry

wing_section_widget --> airfoils
wing: has_aft_fuel_tank
airfoil: type (dropdown), code(optional -> depends on airfoil type, deactivate if no dropdown is chosen? - google it), file name, points
if type & code chosen, deactivate path field and vice versa
